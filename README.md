Encryption protocols for the disk, Internet connections from host/client on Intranet bridge are also encrypted de-facto, it allows for packet `masquerading` in-place to avoid intermittent connection problems/privacy quips with a given cable provider. The [VPN](https://openvpn.net) may be connected to from any Wi-Fi network in the world which does not block filtered VPN traffic and/or does not allow port forwarding to be in place, traffic is generated within the network rather than on it directly ([obfuscation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/09/29/understanding-the-power-of-network-obfuscation/?sh=4fbcc2054bed)). The build script used to provision the VPN is optimized for aarch64. Three firewalls. rootfs (root) partition is encrypted with the library `cryptsetup` ([12/2017](https://linux.die.net/man/8/cryptsetup)) which is initialized persistently through the bootloader, and the network bridge is using Google's aforementioned encryption protocol from [10/2018](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/720.pdf) (combining Chacha and AES). Tested on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and incoming connections to its VPN server were made on an Apple MacBook M1/iPhone 13 from several home and business networks in Massachusetts.
